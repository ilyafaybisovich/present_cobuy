# Giftbox #

[www.ronin-giftbox.co.uk](https://www.ronin-giftbox.co.uk)

Giftbox is a final project for a team of Ronin students carried out between 18-29 May 2015 at Makers Academy. The team comprised of [Iciar](https://github.com/Icicleta), [Ilya](https://github.com/ilyafaybisovich), [Mark](https://github.com/Gwasanaethau) and [Rob](https://github.com/RBGeomaticsRob).

The whole project was designed and implemented by the team of 4 working remotely using Google Hangouts and Github. The project was implemented using a pair-programming agile BDD approach, with full test-driven development throughout.

Giftbox is a collaborative service to allow groups to collectively purchase gifts for an individual. A simple process allows the user to select a gift, add contributers, take payments and automatically make the purchase and ship on receiving the last contribution.

The project was [presented](https://www.dropbox.com/s/rzkvuqnnk3z3fvo/Presentation.key?dl=0) on 29 May at the Makers Academy Graduation.

##### Approach #####

The team initially met with the client and crafted a set of user stories to better understand the clients requirement. Using these the team then crafted a MVP roadmap being aware of the basic domain design upfront, but letting the specifics of this emerge as the project developed.

The group split this MVP roadmaps down into tickets and used a Trello [kanban board](https://trello.com/b/earxI39d/giftbox) to manage the work processes, working in pairs to complete each ticket requirement. Meeting for twice daily standups to check on progress and blockages to the team, including a focus on current test coverage and status.

Rob [blogged](http://rbgeomaticsrob.github.io/) some further details of the progress of the project.

### Giftbox - Making present headaches a thing of the past! ###

### User Stories ###

```
As a cost-aware friend
So that I don’t end up covering other peoples costs
I want an app that encourages a group to collaborate

As the group coordinator
So that I can split the cost evenly
I want to be able to add the present and the cost

As a picky shopper
So that I can have a large range of products available to choose from
I want to be able to select products from amazon

As a secretive member of the present-buying community
So that the recipient is not aware of our plans
I want to restrict access to my present-buying page

As a time-limited friend
So that I don’t have to deal with the complexity
I want the app to be able to manage purchasing (including dispatch)
```
